  # pixel-racks
A pixel art collection of A/V rackmount gear.

## What the heck is this thing?
Pixel Racks is a silly little way to make A/V racks using a image program like Paint or GIMP. 

## How do I use it?
Simply import a rack from the `Rack` folder, Then import a device from any of the other folders, and place to your hearts desire!

## Why does this exist? 
Simply because it can, And the original plan was to help me design racks for my audio gear in a easy fashion that also had a "standard"

## Can I make my own?
Of course! The standard dimensions of 1RU is 182x19. The height however can change depending on how many RU the device your making is. 
And if you create one, feel free to contribute! Did you make one that looks better? yay! Feel free to contribute it!
